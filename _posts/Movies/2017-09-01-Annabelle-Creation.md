In 1946, a doll maker, Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia), is crafting a new piece of work - the doll that would later be known as Annabelle. While working, Samuel gets a small note from his daughter Annabelle/"Bee" (Samara Lee) to play hide-and-seek. Samuel finds her and starts tickling her, joined by his wife Esther (Miranda Otto).

The Mullins family later goes to church. A patron asks Samuel when his next batch of dolls will be ready, and Esther says they are good to go. On the way home, the family gets a flat tire. Esther sees a car coming and tries to flag it down. As Samuel is removing the tire, a bolt comes loose. Bee goes to grab it but doesn't see the car coming, and it fatally strikes her.

Twelve years later in 1958, a nun, Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman), is traveling in a van with six orphaned girls - Janice (Talitha Bateman), Linda (Lulu Wilson), Carol (Grace Fulton), Nancy (Philippa Coulthard), Kate (Tayler Buck), and Tierney (Lou Lou Safran). Janice and Linda are best friends, but Janice is disabled due to suffering from polio. The girls arrive at the Mullins home as they have opened it up to them as their new home. We hear that Esther had suffered from an accident years earlier, and not much else is known about her. Samuel shows Janice a chairlift originally made for Esther so she can use to move up and down the stairs.
